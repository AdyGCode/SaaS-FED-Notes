SaaS-CAD-Session-01-Lesson-Plan.docx

I will present you with the lesson/session plan for a week in a Laravel Front-End Development (Cloud Application Development) cluster. You previously created this document, and I will add further details to the requirements from the lesson plan.

Provide the content for the lesson including:
- content for slides,
- sample code
- diagrams should come from external sources or be produced in TEXT only format.
- exercises for the students to practice the content of the class
- ten questions relating to the content to act as a review quiz (each question will need to be multiple choice, with possibly more than one answer correct. The questions and answers may include code extracts).

Could you create a Markdown version of the content, place the quiz questions into a separate markdown document, sample code into another markdown document using code fencing (```), likewise for the student exercises, a separate file.

PHP 8.4 and later will be targeted
