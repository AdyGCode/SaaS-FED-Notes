### Exercise 1

If you created the files from the previous exercises in the `session-03` (or session 04) folder, then you will first duplicate these files into your `session-05` folder.

We will start by refactoring the files we currently have:

- rename the `contact-save.php` to `contact-form-display.php`

Create the following PHP files:

- `contact-save.php`
- `database.php`

In the `database.php` file create a database class that may be
used to connect to, and then access the `XXX_SaaS_FED_2024_S2` database.

In the `contact-save.php` file you are to save the data to the database 
in a table called `form_submissions`.
