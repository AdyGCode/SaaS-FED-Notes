# Laravel Bootcamp: Part 7

## Administration Front End

In this section we will start to add an administration/management front-end that allows users with particular rights to perform management actions on data in the Chirp system.

We will:
- Build User Management Interface
- Determine Roles to use in Application
- Determine Permissions each Role will have
- Apply Roles & Permissions to Application (User Management)


## Before you start…

Have you completed (not just read):

- [Introducing Laravel](session-10/S10-Introducing-Laravel-v11.md),
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 1](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-1.md),
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 2](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-2.md)
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 3](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-3.md)
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 4](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-4.md)
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 5](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-5.md)
- [Laravel Boot Camp - Part 6](session-11/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-6.md)

No? Well… go do it…

You will need these to be able to continue…

> **Important:** You should understand that whilst you are completing this tutorial, you will
> only see parts of the application working when a stage is complete.
>
> So if you get an error in the browser, it may be because there is something missing.
