# Laravel Bootcamp: Part 13

## Deploying to ScreenCraft

In this part of the bootcamp, we will now look at how to deploy to a server using our Git 
Repository.

The deployment will be to a "testing" server, but provides the concepts for deploying to 
production.

# Deployment

There are different ways to deploy an application. It may be via an installer application, 
uploading a compressed file, via version control and others.

In this part of the bootcamp, we investigate how to use GitHub to deploy to a VPS that will 
host the application.

## GitHub Workflows

## ScreenCraft

ScreenCraft is a service provided to **Students** and **Staff** from North Metropolitan 
TAFE. 

We provide hosting facilities for students who are studying a number of different 
qualifications that develop skills in technologies related to Web design and development, and 
Software as a Service design and development.

We also provide hosting for sites that are part of the teaching within other areas including 
[Boom Radio](https://boomradio.com.au) which is used for skills development within courses 
such as the [Diploma of Screen and Media (Broadcast Radio and Podcasting)
](https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/courses/diploma-screen-and-media-broadcast-radio-and-podcasting).

During the various courses, we also provide development and testing facilities for students 
as they design and develop solutions for projects which are part of our LiveWorks industrial 
experience concept. 

These projects provide real-life experience to the students in working with real 
clients, and on real problems. All work is NOT FOR PROFIT and at the end of the project, a 
prototype or proof of concept is provided to the client.

We have a number of recurring clients, who are deeply appreciated for their ongoing support 
with this endeavour.

### How may I Host with You?

Hosting is ONLY available to staff and students of North Metropolitan TAFE.

Requesting hosting on ScreenCraft is done via your lecturer.

### Period of Hosting

Students are provided with hosting for the period of study within a related course, plus a 
maximum of 180 days after their last enrolment period.
