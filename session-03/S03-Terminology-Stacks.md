# The Terminology of Stacks

## Front-End

The front-end is user facing. 

It consists of the web pages and all the logic surrounding that. 

Javascript is often used to add interactivity to web pages.

- HTML, CSS (LESS, etc.)
- JavaScript, Typescript, Coffeescript

## Back-End

The back-end is what does the heavy lifting. 

Nowadays, websites aren’t just a simple HTML page. 

Data is stored, users are managed, images can be uploaded, etc.

- OS (e.g., Linux)
- Web server (Apache, nginx, Caddy, …)
- Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, RavenDB, Couchbase, MongoDB, …)
- Storage (HDD, SSD)
- Hosting
- Language (PHP, Python, C#, Go, Rust, …)
- Web development frameworks (Ruby On Rails, Laravel, Flask, Django, …)
