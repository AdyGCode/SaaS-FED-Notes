# Database Terminology

## DBMS

DBMS stands for Database Management System, which is software that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database.

## NoSQL

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and refers to databases designed to handle unstructured data and large-scale data storage, often used for big data and real-time web applications.

## SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

## Relational DB

A Relational Database is a type of database that stores data in tables with rows and columns, where data relationships are defined through foreign keys.

## Hierarchical DB

A Hierarchical Database is a type of database that organizes data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent and potentially many children.

## Graph DB

A Graph Database is a type of database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data, emphasizing relationships between data points.

## Key-Value Store

A Key-Value Store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and used to retrieve its associated value.

## ORM

ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, which is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a database using object-oriented programming languages.

## ODBC

ODBC stands for Open Database Connectivity, which is a standard API for accessing database management systems.

## JDBC

## Abstract Data Objects (ADO.NET)

ADO.NET stands for ActiveX Data Objects .NET, which is a set of computer software components that can be used by programmers to access data and data services.

## Service Data Objects (SDO)

Service Data Objects is a specification for a data programming architecture that unifies data programming across different types of data sources.

## PHP Data Objects (PDO)

PHP Data Objects is a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases in PHP, abstracting database operations through a consistent interface.
