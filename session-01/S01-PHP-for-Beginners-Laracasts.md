| 01  | [How to Choose a Programming Language](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2551 "How to Choose a Programming Language")                                               | How exactly do you choose a first programming to learn? Why PHP, and not Ruby? And what about JavaScript or Python? How can you possibly be expected to make an educated decision at this early stage of your learning?                                                                                                          |                1m 21s |
| 02  | [Tools of the Trade](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2552 "Tools of the Trade")                                                                                   | Before we can dig in, we must first create the world, so to speak. To follow along with this series, you'll need to install a handful of essential tools. Let's go over them in this episode.                                                                                                                                    |                8m 37s |
| 03  | [Your First PHP Tag](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2554 "Your First PHP Tag")                                                                                   | Our first order of business is to prepare some basic HTML, boot a PHP server, and view it in the browser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                8m 09s |
| 04  | [Variables](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2555 "Variables")                                                                                                     | Okay, let's move on and review basic concatenation and variables. The first time I learned about variables, my first thought was, "But why?". Let's talk about it!                                                                                                                                                               |                7m 18s |
| 05  | [Conditionals and Booleans](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2556 "Conditionals and Booleans")                                                                     | For this next episode, we'll build a quick webpage that displays a dynamic message based upon whether or not you've read a particular book. This will give us the opportunity to review both conditionals and booleans.                                                                                                          |                11m 06s |
| 06  | [Arrays](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2559 "Arrays")                                                                                                           | At this point, you know how to create a variable for a primitive string or number. But what about situations when we want to declare a collection, or list of things? A list of usernames, or book titles, or tweets? In these situations, we can reach for arrays.                                                              |                8m 37s |
| 07  | [Associative Arrays](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2561 "Associative Arrays")                                                                                   | Let's stick with arrays just a little longer. In this episode, you'll learn the syntax for accessing individual items within an array. You'll also learn about associative arrays, which allow you to associate a key with each value.                                                                                           |                7m 19s |
| 08  | [Functions and Filters](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2562 "Functions and Filters")                                                                             | Congratulations for making it this far! Let's take things a step further now and review functions. You can think of functions as the verbs of the programming world.                                                                                                                                                             |                12m 20s |
| 09  | [Lambda Functions](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2564 "Lambda Functions")                                                                                       | Buckle up, because we have a lot to cover in this episode! As part of our first code refactor, we'll discuss what lambda functions are, as well as when and why you might reach for them.                                                                                                                                        |                12m 08s |
| 10  | [Separate Logic From the Template](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2565 "Separate Logic From the Template")                                                       | Before we move on to the technical check-in for this chapter, let's set aside a bit of time to discuss code organization and why we might want to separate our PHP logic from the view, or HTML.                                                                                                                                 |                8m 35s |
| 11  | [Technical Check-in #1 (With Exam)](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2567 "Technical Check-in #1 (With Exam)")                                                     | Before we move on to section two, let's do a quick technical check-in to ensure that everything you've learned so far has been committed to memory. And don't forget to complete the quiz before continuing.                                                                                                                     |                4m 53s |
|     |                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   |
| 2.  | **Dynamic Web Applications **                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | |
| 12  | [Page Links](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2569 "Page Links")                                                                                                   | Welcome to section two! While section one focused entirely on the initial fundamentals of PHP, now, we'll move on and learn what it looks like to build a typical PHP application with a MySQL database.                                                                                                                         |                11m 01s |
| 13  | [PHP Partials](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2571 "PHP Partials")                                                                                               | In the previous episode, we begrudgingly duplicated the same HTML for every PHP view. Let's fix that now by reaching for PHP partials.                                                                                                                                                                                           |                9m 10s |
| 14  | [Superglobals and Current Page Styling](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2573 "Superglobals and Current Page Styling")                                             | Often, you'll need to apply styles or trigger certain logic based upon the current page. Luckily, we can use PHP's `$_SERVER` superglobal array to dynamically determine the current page.                                                                                                                                       |                12m 57s |
| 15  | [Make a PHP Router](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2576 "Make a PHP Router")                                                                                     | I think your PHP skills have now matured to the point that you're ready to build a custom PHP router from scratch. This will give us the chance to discuss code organization, response codes, and more.                                                                                                                          |                18m 02s |
| 16  | [Create a MySQL Database](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2577 "Create a MySQL Database")                                                                         | We're now ready to begin interacting with a MySQL database. Before we write any PHP, let's first review how to connect to MySQL, and then create a database and table.                                                                                                                                                           |                6m 10s |
| 17  | [PDO First Steps](https://laracasts.com/episodes/2578 "PDO First Steps")                                                                                         | The next step on our journey is to figure out how to connect to MySQL from PHP and execute a simple SELECT query. We'll of course reach for PHP Data Objects, or PDO, to orchestrate this task securely.                                                                                                                         |                14m 24s |

The connection values have been hard-coded. So what happens when we push the project to production, where the host and port are entirely different?                                                                                                               |                12m 59s |

Once filled, we can create a new user in the database and then update the session to "mark" them as signed in.                                                                                                              |                18m 59s |

We'll create two middleware classes to handle route authorization for guests and authenticated users.                                                                 |                22m 04s |

Let's fix that. In this episode, we'll discuss the importance of password hashing, and why it's necessary to protect your users' sensitive data. We'll also discuss the Bcrypt algorithm, and how it can be used to generate secure hashes.              |                4m 49s |

As you'll see, there's a small handful of confusing, low-level steps that we need to follow - particularly when logging a user out.                                                                                                 |                25m 45s |

This approach will allow us to keep our controllers lean, clear, and easier to potentially reuse in other places.                                                                                                                              |                13m 28s |

This new class can then be responsible for handling the actual authentication logic.                                                                                                                                 |                13m 21s |

Currently, we're returning a view directly from the `POST` request in the event of failed validation, however, this is far from ideal. Let's review the problem, and then seek a solution.     |                21m 17s |

If we can manage to get this to work, we'll remove a significant amount of duplication and clutter from our various controllers.                                                                                                     |                26m 07s |

Composer is a world-class dependency manager that allows us to declare any and all libraries or packages that our project requires. Then, with a single command, we can install them in seconds. Even better, it ships with an excellent autoloader. |                13m 12s |
