# Session 01 Exercises, Practice and External Supporting Courses

Make sure you have:

- Created a JetBrains Account
- Set up Terminal on the Windows systems
- Set up Bash on the Windows Systems

At home, ensure you have a suitable development environment ready for Session 02.

When possible it is easier to mimic the same environment that we are using in class.

# External Coursework

You have a number of options to use to back up the study in class.

A Session by Session study plan is given on separate pages. Select one of the courses to use for your external study. Some will cover more material than others.

They all vary in length of time.

The options we provide (you may find alternatives and recommend to the lecturers to add):
- [S01-PHP](session-01/S01-PHP.md)
- [S01-PHP-from-Scratch-Beginner-to-Advanced](session-01/S01-PHP-from-Scratch-Beginner-to-Advanced.md)
- [S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Laracasts](session-01/S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Laracasts.md)
- [S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Crash-Course-Study-Schedule](S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Crash-Course-YouTube.md)
