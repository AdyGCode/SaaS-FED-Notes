# Session 01 Exercises and Journal Entry

Make sure you have:

- Created a JetBrains Account
- Set up Terminal on the Windows systems
- Set up Bash on the Windows Systems
- 

At home, ensure you have a suitable development environment ready for Session 02.

When possible it is easier to mimic the same environment that we are using in class.
