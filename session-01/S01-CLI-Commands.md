# The CLI

Many people will not be familiar with the CLI, or Command Line Interface.

This is a disadvantage to any developer, be they a web, software or other area of IT.

We recommend becoming familiar with some of the basic commands, and some extra commands.

## Getting ready for a CLI

Before starting there are two ways to make sure you have a suitable CLI.

### Installations

#### Windows Users

Possible ways to get a `*nix` type prompt:

1. Install Git from the https://git-scm.com and use the `git/bin/bash.exe` file for the command
   prompt
2. Install Laragon and use the `Laragon\bin\gity\bin\bash.exe` file as the command prompt
3. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use a co-hosted copy of Linux on your PC
   (Advanced users)

Once you have access to a `bash` shell then we recommend installing the Windows Terminal
application. This provides multiple tabs, split screens and more to your CLI sessions. [See
below.](#Terminals)

#### Mac Users

You will have either `z-shell` or `bash` installed by default. In later versions of MacOS,
`z-shell` is default.

#### Linux Users

In most cases you will have `bash` installed by default.

## Terminals

We recommend different applications depending on the operating system.

Adrian uses Warp on the Mac, and Windows Terminal on the PC.
