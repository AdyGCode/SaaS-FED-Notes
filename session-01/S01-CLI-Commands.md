# The CLI

Many people will not be familiar with the CLI, or Command Line Interface.

This is a disadvantage to any developer, be they a web, software or other area of IT.

We recommend becoming familiar with some of the basic commands, and some extra commands.

## Getting ready for a CLI

Before starting there are two ways to make sure you have a suitable CLI.

### Installations
#### Windows Users
1. Install Git from the https://git-scm.com and use the `git/bin/bash.exe` file for the command prompt
2. Install Laragon and use the `Laragon\bin\gity\bin\bash.exe` file as the command prompt
#### Mac Users

You will have either `z-shell` or `bash` installed by default
#### Linux Users

In most cases you will have `bash` installed by default.
## Terminals

We recommend different applications depending on the operating system.
