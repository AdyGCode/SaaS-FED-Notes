# Session 01 Exercises, Practice and External Supporting Courses

Make sure you have:

- a Source/Repos folder in the 'root' of your user profile (see
  [SQuASH system's FAQs](https://help.screencraft.net.au) for more details).
- Set up a JetBrains Account
- Set up Terminal on the Windows systems
- Set up Bash on the Windows Systems

### For working at Home...

At home, ensure you have a suitable development environment ready for Session 02.
  - When possible, it is easier to mimic the same environment that we are using in class.

Optionally, you may want to install Obsidian for more comprehensive Markdown file editing 
and notetaking. We provide details of a suitable set-up, and a downloadable starter 
**vault** via the [SQuASH system's FAQs](https://help.screencraft.net.au).


# Setting Up Exercise

You will have created the Source/Repos folder in your user profile's root folder.

Open PhpStorm and use the steps:

- Hamburger Icon
    - File
        - New Project
        - Empty Project
        - Make sure you have teh correct folder (`c:\Users\USERNAME\Source\Repos` or
          `/Users/USERNAME/Source/Repos/` or `/home/USERNAME/Source/Repos/`) shown at the start
          of the location.
        - Replace `untitled` with `ICT50220-SaaS-FED-Exercises`
        - Click OK

In this new project place a copy of the [Base ReadMe file](../assets/ReadMe-Base.md) and 
rename it to `ReadMe.md`.

Update the file with appropriate information.

Also in this new project add an empty file, `Learning-PHP.md`.

Finally, add a file called `Research.md`. This file will be where you add your weekly 
research and answers to questions in the "Recap Exercises and Practice" markdown files.

Some will cover more material than others, and they all vary in length of time.
