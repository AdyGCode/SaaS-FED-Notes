# PHP - Supplementary Learning

If you have no PHP experience then we recommend checking out the schedules outlined below, selecting one and do a crash course on PHP over the first 5 weeks of this cluster.

We are going to be using PHP v8.2 or higher, most PHP courses covering v7.4 and above are still relevant, but PHP v8 introduced some really nice features and improvements over the previous iteration.

1. [PHP for Beginners (Laracasts, Free)](session-01/S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Laracasts.md)
2. [PHP for Beginners - Crash Course (YouTube, Free)](S01-PHP-for-Beginners-Crash-Course-YouTube.md)
3. [Object Oriented PHP and MVC (O'Reilly, Free as a student)](./S01-Object-Oriented-PHP-and-MVC-OReilly.md)
4. [S01-PHP-from-Scratch-Beginner-to-Advanced (Traversy Media, Paid)](session-01/S01-PHP-from-Scratch-Beginner-to-Advanced.md)

There are other options also in the O'Reilly books collection, including books and video based courses.
