# Exercises

There are some exercises embedded in the notes.



# Reflection Questions

These are based on the tutorial. Consider them, and if you wish, add notes to your journal.

## Question 1: Data Binding

What could we do to make sure that the data being entered is the correct type?

How difficult would this be to implement?


## Question 2: Refactoring

There are sections of code in the application that are repeated, how could you refactor this code to reduce replication?


## Question 3: Exceptions!

Currently we have many places that exceptions could occur.

Consider how you could make the application display a more meaningful and user friendly error when such a situation occurs.
