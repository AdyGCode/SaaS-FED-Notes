# Testing the whole application

OK, so  it's time for you test the application.

This is going to be an exercise as we want you to practice thinking about what tests would be required for an application.

You should:
- Create a list of the features and the sub features to test
- Create sample data that will test success and failure of your features
- Execute each test in turn, noting results and issues

We suggest using a table to help that could be similar to this:

| Feature  | Sub-Feature | Test Data                                       | Expected Result                                             | Actual Result | Notes |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Users    | Login       | email: user1@example.com<br>password: Password1 | Returns to home page<br>Login/Register replaced with Logout |               |       |
|          | Register    |                                                 |                                                             |               |       |
|          | Logout      |                                                 |                                                             |               |       |
|          |             |                                                 |                                                             |               |       |
| Products | ...         |                                                 |                                                             |               |       |
