# Laravel Bootcamp Part 2

The following notes are based on the official Laravel Boot Camp (Build Chirper with Blade https://bootcamp.laravel.com) with Adrian's shortened explanations.

## Before you start...

Have you gone over the [S10 Introducing Laravel](session-10/S10-Introducing-Laravel.md) and then [S10 Laravel Boot Camp Part 1](session-10/S10-Laravel-BootCamp-Part-1.md) ?

No? Well... go do it...

We will wait here until you are ready.
