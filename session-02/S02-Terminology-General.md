# General Terms

## Business Domain

The business domain is the specific area of expertise or industry that a business operates within.

Additional information in [S02 Terminology - Business Domain](../session-02/S02-Terminology-Business-Domain).


## Design and Development Terminology


### CLI

CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems by typing commands.

### Command Shell

There are many types of command shells, and they depend, for the most part, on the operating system. 

- Linux has access to Bash, C Shell, Z Shell and more.
- Windows has the Windows Command shell and PowerShell. It also has access to other shells when Windows Subsystem for Linux is installed and a suitable Linux version is added. There are also other options for adding Linux style shells as well.
- MacOS has Z Shell as the default but access to Bash and C-Shell.

From experience, many lecturers will use the Bash, Z-Shell or similar, even with Windows.

Adrian Gould's Diigo account contains many links that will provide options, plus also he has a MyBib account with many references in APA v6+.

### Version Control

Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### CI/CD

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, which are practices in software development that automate testing and deployment to ensure code changes are integrated and released frequently.

### UX

UX stands for User Experience, which refers to the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service, focusing on ease of use and satisfaction.

### UI

UI stands for User Interface, which is the visual and interactive elements of a product or service that a user interacts with, such as buttons, menus, and screens.

### IDE

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, which is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.

### MVP

Minimal Viable product.

### YAGNI

You Ain't Gonna Need It.


## Network & Systems

There are a number of network and systems related terms that include Client, Server, Network, LAN, PAN, WAN, and many more. See the [S02 Terminology - Network and Internet](../session-02/S02-Terminology-Network-Internet.md) article for details on terms not shown below.

### Client

A client is a computer or software that requests services, resources, or data from a server.

### Server

A server is a computer or software that provides services, resources, or data to clients over a network.

### Host

A host is any system that is a client or a server. This also includes network specific items such as  Switches, Routers and Firewalls. A Host will have its own unique reference address so data that may be directed as needed to the specific host.

## Containerisation, Virtualisation and Bare Metal

### Containerisation

Containerisation is a lightweight form of virtualisation that involves packaging an application and its dependencies together in a container to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.

### Virtualisation

Virtualisation is the process of creating virtual versions of physical components, such as servers, storage devices, and network resources, to optimise and manage computing resources.

### Bare Metal

Refers to the *actual physical hardware* that a system is running on. In most cases this means that the operating system, the application support services and other systems run on an actual computer rather than within a Virtual machines or Containerisation system.

## Servers

Web and other types of applicaitons often rely on a variety of server systems. These range from Database Servers to Web Severs to Mail servers and beyond.

### Web Server

A Web Server is a system that delivers web pages to users' browsers by processing HTTP requests.

### Database Server

A Database Server is a server that provides database services to other computer programs or computers using a client-server model.

### Application Server

An Application Server is a server that hosts applications and provides business logic for application programs through various protocols.

### SMTP Server

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Server - aka Mail Server

### MQTT Server

Message Queue Telementry Transport Server

### FTP Server

File Transfer Protocol Server

### SSH Server

Secure Shell server




## Application Types


### Monolithic Application

A Monolithic Application is a software application that is designed as a single, cohesive unit where all components are interconnected and interdependent.

### Microservice

A microservice is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable component services. These services will often communicate via some form of defined API, or Application Programming Interface.
