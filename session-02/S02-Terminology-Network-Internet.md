# Networking & Internet Terms

These terms relate to the Internet, networking and SaaS. They are important to know and to be able to identify the differences as needed.

## Network

> "A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
> 
> Two very common types of networks include:
> 
> - [Local Area Network (LAN)](https://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap1/chap1.htm#LocalAreaNetwork)
> - [Wide Area Network (WAN)](https://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap1/chap1.htm#WideAreaNetwork)"

### The Internet (upper-case 'i')

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through standardised protocols to share information and resources.

### An internet (lower-case 'i')

An internet is a smaller, private network of interconnected computers within an organisation that uses Internet protocols. It usually connects servers and services between buildings, and geographically different locations.

### An intranet

An intranet is a private network accessible only to an organisation's staff, used to share information, resources, and communication within the organisation.

### An extranet

An extranet is a private network that allows controlled access to outsiders, such as business partners or clients, to specific internal resources of an organisation.

### WAN

A **==WAN==** or **==Wide Area Network==** is when networks connect to another network. The Internet is the biggest example of a ==WAN==. It is such a big network it is often called the network of networks.

### LAN  

A **==LAN==** or **==Local Area Network==** is a group of devices all connected in the same location. The network you might have at home and at school is an example of a LAN. Colleges, Business and your home will often have LANs.

### PAN

A **==PAN==** or **==Personal Area Network==** is when devices like bluetooth headphones are connected to a smartphone or tablet. When the two devices connect, information can be shared.

## Protocols


### TCP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, which is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite that ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.

### IP

IP stands for Internet Protocol, which is a set of rules for routing and addressing packets of data so they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.

### TCP/IP

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, which is the suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the Internet.

### UDP

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol, which is a communication protocol that allows data to be sent without establishing a connection, making it faster but less reliable than TCP.

### SMTP

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a protocol for sending emails across the Internet.

### FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over a TCP-based network.

### DHCP

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks.


## Interprocess Communication

> The Windows operating system provides mechanisms for facilitating communications and data sharing between applications. 
>  
>  Collectively, the activities enabled by these mechanisms are called _interprocess communications_ (IPC). 
>   
>   Some forms of IPC facilitate the division of labour among several specialized processes. 
>   
>   Other forms of IPC facilitate the division of labour among computers on a network.

### Socket

A Socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network, allowing communication between different processes on the same or different machines.

### Named Pipes

Named Pipes are a method for inter-process communication that allows data to be transferred between different processes, even on different computers over a network.

## URL, URI and URN

### URL

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is the address used to access resources (on the Internet), such as a website or a file.

### URI

URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier, which is a string that identifies a resource either by location (**URL**) or by name (**URN**).

## cURL

cURL is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URLs, supporting various protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and more.

## Proxy

A Proxy is an intermediary server that separates end users from the websites they browse, providing various functions like security, privacy, and caching.

## Router

A Router is a device that forwards data packets between computer networks, directing the data along the most efficient paths.

## VPS

VPS stands for Virtual Private Server, which is a virtual machine provided by an Internet hosting service that runs its own copy of an operating system.

## VPN

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, which is a service that encrypts your internet connection and hides your online activity, providing privacy and security.
