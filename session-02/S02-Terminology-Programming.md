# Programming Terminology

Our first set of terms relates to general concepts within programming.

### WET
- Write everything twice.

### DRY
- Don't Repeat Yourself

### KISS
- Keep It Simple Stupid


### Convention vs Configuration

Convention vs Configuration is a design philosophy where software defaults to standard conventions to reduce the need for custom configurations, making it easier to use out of the box.

[Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) is a simple concept that is primarily used in programming. It means that the environment in which you work (systems, libraries, language…) assumes many logical situations by default, so if you adapt to them rather than creating your own rules each time, programming becomes an easier and more productive task.

The goal is to **decrease the number of decisions** the programmer has to make and **eliminate the complexity** of having to configure all and each of the areas of application development. The immediate result is that you can create many more things in less time.

### Idempotence

A property of (certain) operations, where performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as performing it once. 

That is, if you have the number 1 and 3 and add them then the result is 4. No matter how many times you do the same calculation, the results will always be the same.


### Stateful programming

Stateful programming is a programming paradigm where the system or application retains information about previous interactions and can change its behaviour based on that information.

### Stateless programming

Stateless programming is a programming paradigm where each request or interaction is independent and does not rely on previous interactions or stored state.


## Object Oriented Programming



### Modularisation

**Modularisation** is the process of dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently but function together as a whole.

### OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and methods.

### Class

A **Class** is a blueprint in object-oriented programming for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

### Object

An **Object** is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming that encapsulates data and behavior related to that data.

### Method

A **Method** is a function defined within a class in object-oriented programming that operates on objects of that class.



## Database Programming

There are many terms relating to Databases. They indude general terms such as CRUD and ACID, as wellas morespcific terms such as 


### CRUD

**CRUD** (Acronym) stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database or a data store.

### BREAD

**BREAD** (Acronym) stands for Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete, which are five standard operations used in user interfaces to manage data.


### ORM 

ORM (Initialism) stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a layer in software development that makes it easier to interact between databases and the data they hold, and the code you are writing. They often provide a structured and easy to read syntax that (almost) removes the need to have a full understanding of the datavnbase's query syntax.


ACID


### DAL


### Query Language


### Relational Database


### No SQL Database


### Hybrid Databases
