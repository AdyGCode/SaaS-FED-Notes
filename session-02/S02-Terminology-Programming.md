# Programming Terminology

Our first set of terms relates to general concepts within programming.

### WET

Write everything twice.

### DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself

### KISS

Keep It Simple Stupid


### Convention vs Configuration

Convention vs Configuration is a design philosophy where software defaults to standard conventions to reduce the need for custom configurations, making it easier to use out of the box.

### Idempotence

A property of (certain) operations in which performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as performing it once is known as **idempotence**. That is, if you have the number 1 and 3 and add them then the result is 4. No matter how many times you do the same calculation, the results will always be the tame.


### Stateful programming

Stateful programming is a programming paradigm where the system or application retains information about previous interactions and can change its behaviour based on that information.

### Stateless programming

Stateless programming is a programming paradigm where each request or interaction is independent and does not rely on previous interactions or stored state.


## Object Oriented Programming



### Modularisation

**Modularisation** is the process of dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently but function together as a whole.

### OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and methods.

### Class

A **Class** is a blueprint in object-oriented programming for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

### Object

An **Object** is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming that encapsulates data and behavior related to that data.

### Method

A **Method** is a function defined within a class in object-oriented programming that operates on objects of that class.



## Database Programming

There are many terms relating to Databases. They indude general terms such as CRUD and ACID, as wellas morespcific terms such as 


### CRUD

**CRUD** (Acronym) stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database or a data store.

### BREAD

**BREAD** (Acronym) stands for Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete, which are five standard operations used in user interfaces to manage data.


### ORM 

ORM (Initialism) stands for Object-Relational Mapping. It is a layer in software development that makes it easier to interact between databases and the data they hold, and the code you are writing. They often provide a structured and easy to read syntax that (almost) removes the need to have a full understanding of the datavnbase's query syntax.


ACID


### DAL


### Query Language


### Relational Database


### No SQL Database


### Hybrid Databases


### Table of Database Terms and Types
