# Programming Terminology

## Stateful programming

Stateful programming is a programming paradigm where the system or application retains information about previous interactions and can change its behavior based on that information.

## Stateless programming

Stateless programming is a programming paradigm where each request or interaction is independent and does not rely on previous interactions or stored state.

## Idempotency

Idempotency is a property of certain operations in which performing the same operation multiple times results in the same outcome as performing it once.

## Version Control

Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## CLI

CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems by typing commands.

## Convention vs Configuration

Convention vs Configuration is a design philosophy where software defaults to standard conventions to reduce the need for custom configurations, making it easier to use out of the box.

## OOP

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and methods.

## Method

A Method is a function defined within a class in object-oriented programming that operates on objects of that class.

## Class

A Class is a blueprint in object-oriented programming for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.

## Object

An Object is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming that encapsulates data and behavior related to that data.

## Modularisation

Modularisation is the process of dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained independently but function together as a whole.

## CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete, which are the four basic operations for managing data in a database or a data store.

## BREAD

BREAD stands for Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete, which are five standard operations used in user interfaces to manage data.
