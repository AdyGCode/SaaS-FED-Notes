# Web Terminology

We will split this into sections starting with the Web Page Hierarchy, and continue through to briefly introduce possibly new concepts.


## Web Page Hierarchy

Web pages are built on a four layer system, no matter if the code behind the scenes is something like PHP, Ruby or similar.

The layers are (Most important is at the bottom):

- Interactivity (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Style (CSS, which adds the colours, typography et al)
- Structure (Semantic HTML, which organises the content)
- Content (The what the user sees and reads)

### Content


### HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is the standard language for creating and designing web pages and web applications.

### CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.


### ECMAScript


### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

JavaScript is the common name applied by many in the Web Industry to ECMAScript.

### TypeScript

TypeScript extends the ECMAScript standard to provide features that are commonly associated with higher level languages such as strong typing.




## DOM

DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects.

## AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages by updating parts of a web page without reloading the whole page.

## JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## XML

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, which is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

## CDN

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location to improve load times and performance.

## FTP

FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and server on a computer network.

## PWA

PWA stands for Progressive Web App, which is a type of application software delivered through the web that is built using common web technologies and intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser.

## SaaS

SaaS or Software as a Service. Web applications that may be free to use, or cost a subscription or some form. They often provide a set of unique facilities for the client, be that individual, a company or enterprise.

# Web Protocol Terms

## HTTP

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, allowing web browsers and servers to communicate.

### HTTP versions: v1, v1.1

HTTP version 1.0 and 1.1 are early versions of the HyperText Transfer Protocol, with 1.1 introducing improvements like persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding.

### HTTP versions v2, v3

HTTP version 2 and version 3 are newer versions of the HyperText Transfer Protocol that introduce features like multiplexing, header compression, and improved performance and security.

## HTTPS

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, which is HTTP with encryption for secure communication over a computer network.

## HTTP Verb

An HTTP Verb, also known as an HTTP method, is a command used in HTTP requests to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource, such as GET, POST, or DELETE.

### GET

GET is an HTTP verb used to request data from a server at a specified resource.

### POST

POST is an HTTP verb used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.

### PATCH

PATCH is an HTTP verb used to apply partial modifications to a resource on a server.

### PUT

PUT is an HTTP verb used to send data to a server to create or replace a resource.

### DELETE

DELETE is an HTTP verb used to request the removal of a resource from a server.

### INFO

INFO is not a standard HTTP verb, but if used, it typically refers to a request for information or status about a resource or operation.

## HTTP Request

An HTTP Request is a message sent by a client to a server asking for a resource or action to be performed on a resource.

### HTTP Request Structure

The HTTP Request Structure consists of a request line (method, URL, and HTTP version), headers (additional information), and an optional body (data sent to the server).
